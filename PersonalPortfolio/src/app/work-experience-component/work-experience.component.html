        <div class="job-title">Software Developer Co-op</div>
        <div class="time-and-loc">Cincinnati, OH  August 2023-December 2023</div>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; For my second co-op rotation at LCS I worked as a full-stack software developer. My duties ranged over many domains 
            including developing new features for the application. When creating new features it started with defining requirements for the 
            feature, then writing the SQL scripts to update the database, build up the api stack, design the front-end for the feature, and 
            then connecting all the parts so the new feature worked seamlessly with the existing application. After creating a new feature 
            I would present the feature to our stakeholders and my managers. Other than developing new features I worked on debugging and 
            creating solutions for bugs reported by QA testers and customers. Apart from programming I participated in retrospective 
            meetings to help improve development processes and team workflow. Throughout this co-op rotation I gained and improved on many 
            skills such as TypeScript, SQL, HTML/CSS, C#, Git, Angular, NgRx, and my teamwork skills.

        <div class="time-and-loc">Cincinnati, OH  January 2023-April 2023</div>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I worked as a Quality Assurance Tester for my first co-op rotation at LCS. Some of my duties included testing bug fixes,
            new features, and checklist testing before the application was deployed to production. It was my job to ensure that customers got a
            clean, polished, and working product. While working as a QA Tester I worked together with developers to guarantee I understood their
            solutions and could test them in the best way possible. Throughout this co-op rotation I gained valuable experience in technologies such as
            Katalon, Postman, and Apache JMeter. I was also able to boost my communication and teamwork skills as I was constantly working with other
            developers and QAs to improve the product as much as possible.

        <div class="time-and-loc">Cincinnati, OH  May 2020-March 2023</div>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Back around when the COVID pandemic started my brother, a friend, and I started a woodworking business. We made 
            anything from end tables, flags, dining tables, and artwork. To make sure we were profitable we had to plan out each project to 
            keep track of our finances for everything we bought and sold. To sell our tables we created an Etsy marketplace as well as setting 
            up booths are fairs. We analyzed trends on social media so we could best market our products to potential customers. Throughout 
            this venture I learned valuable lessons about time management, teamwork, and finances.

        <div class="time-and-loc">Cincinnati, OH  April 2022-August 2022</div>
        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; At The Motz Group I worked as Field Installation Technician which involved the whole process of creating turf fields. 
            To build turf fields I worked together with 5-10 other people. We always had to communicating effectively to ensure the safety 
            since we were constantly using heavy machinery. To effectively participate in the building of the fields I had to pick up many 
            specific skills quickly. I had to adapt to many different situations since I was on different projects in many places over Ohio
            that required a different set of skills. Throughout my time building fields I greatly improved my teamwork and communication 
            skills to ensure these fields were built correctly and safely.
