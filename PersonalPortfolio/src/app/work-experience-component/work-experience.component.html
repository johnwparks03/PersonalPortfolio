          I'm currently conducting research in the UCdasec Lab focused on
          identifying security vulnerabilities in hardware designs written in
          Verilog and SystemVerilog. I’m developing a static analysis tool that
          detects weaknesses based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
          list. My work involves studying CWE structures and detection
          techniques, exploring recent publications on similar methods, and
          implementing rule-based detection strategies. I use Python to process
          and analyze JSON-based abstract syntax trees (ASTs) generated from the
          hardware files to identify patterns that indicate potential
          vulnerabilities.

        <p class="job-description">
          During a semester-long international research program, I worked with
          the VISENS research group to develop an autonomous solution for
          detecting lower-limb spasticity in patients with neurological
          conditions. I used BlazePose, a computer vision model, to track key
          lower-body joints such as the hip, knee, and ankle, and then
          calculated joint angles and angular velocities to support spasticity
          analysis. I also designed an algorithm to detect and correct pose
          estimation errors, improving the reliability of the data. The project
          was implemented in Python, and I concluded the experience by
          presenting my research and findings to the full research team.
          Throughout this experience, I learned to work effectively in a
          multicultural and multilingual environment — adapting my communication
          style, collaborating across language barriers, and building strong
          working relationships with researchers from diverse backgrounds.

          software to support multiple versions of existing hardware, extending
          the life of current equipment. Additionally, I upgraded several
          software packages to use the latest shared codebases, improving both

          During my second co-op at LCS, I worked on the qManage product as a
          full-stack developer. One of my main projects was designing and
          building a new user profile feature that provided improved
          functionality and more detailed user information, enhancing the
          overall user experience. I started by defining functional
          requirements, then wrote SQL scripts to update the database, built the
          API stack, and designed the front-end interface. Once complete, I
          presented the feature to product stakeholders and managers. Beyond
          that, I regularly debugged and resolved issues reported by QA testers
          and customers, and participated in team retrospectives focused on
          improving the development process and workflow. I worked with a wide
          range of technologies including TypeScript, Angular, SQL, HTML/CSS,
          C#, Git, and NgRx.

          testing prior to production deployments. My goal was to ensure the
          product was clean, polished, and functioning as expected. Throughout
          the rotation, I collaborated closely with developers to understand
          their solutions and design more effective test cases that addressed
          potential edge cases. I also contributed to the creation of automated
          tests as the team moved toward a continuous integration workflow. This
          experience shaped the way I approach software development today,
          giving me a strong awareness of how QA thinks, what kinds of bugs are
          commonly caught late, and how to proactively prevent them during
          development. Tools and technologies I used included Katalon Studio,
          Postman, and Apache JMeter.
