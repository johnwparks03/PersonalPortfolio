    <p class="about-me-desc">
      &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a third year computer science student at the University
      of Cincinnati. In my past co-op rotations I have worked as a software
      developer on a web application. Outside of co-ops I love to work on
      anything involving artificial intelligence or web development projects
      such as this website. Aside from programming I enjoy puzzles, building
      legos, reading books, hiking, playing golf, UC sports, and watching
      soccer. You can always catch me watching Liverpool F.C. or F.C. Cincinnati
      or practicing my golf swing.
