    <p class="about-me-desc">
      &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a third year computer science student at the University
      of Cincinnati. On my previous co-op rotations I worked as a software
      developer on a web application. Outside of professional experience I love
      to work on anything involving artificial intelligence or web development
      projects such as this website. Aside from programming I enjoy puzzles,
      reading, hiking, playing golf, UC sports, and watching soccer. You can
      always catch me watching Liverpool F.C. or F.C. Cincinnati or practicing
      my golf swing.
