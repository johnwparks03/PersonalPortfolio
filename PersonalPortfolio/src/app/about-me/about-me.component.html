    <p class="about-me-desc">
      Hi! Welcome to my portfolio. I'm currently a researcher at the University
      of Cincinnati, where I work on detecting hardware security vulnerabilities
      in RTL code. You can learn more about this and my other work experiences
      on my Work Experience page. Outside of work, I enjoy building small
      projects related to my hobbies or that solve a problem of mine, check them
      out on my Projects page. When I'm not coding, you'll find me watching
      College Football and Liverpool FC matches, doing puzzles, hiking, or out
      on the golf course.

      Hi! I’m currently doing research at the University of Cincinnati, where
      I’m working on detecting hardware security vulnerabilities in RTL code.
      Before that, I had some awesome co-op experiences, including artificial
      intelligence research in Spain, building .NET applications as a software
      engineer, and working as a full-stack web developer. I really enjoy
      working on projects that involve AI and web development, particularly
      those where I can build something that makes a meaningful impact. When I’m
      not working, you’ll find me doing puzzles, reading, or hiking. I’m a big
      fan of college football and soccer, I’ve always rooted for Liverpool FC,
      and I started following Sestao River Club when I studied abroad in Bilbao.
      Currently, my favorite thing is golf, whether I’m playing or just thinking
      about how to improve my game.
