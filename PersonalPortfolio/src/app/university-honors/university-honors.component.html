                    <p class="review">This year has been a year of major growth for me. Two major events have happened this past academic year that have made me grow into a man I never would’ve thought of this time last year. In August I moved into my first ever apartment and that came with many new responsibilities such as paying rent, buying groceries and making meals, and everything else that comes with keeping up an apartment. Coming into this year I knew my way around a kitchen, but I had never actually made balanced meals or planned out meals for the week so I could buy the appropriate things at the store. At home if I ever wanted food I looked in the fridge, freezer, or pantry and cooked something up that looked easy and appealing. Planning and cooking my own meals has made me grow into a much more responsible adult. Also, now that I am paying rent, electricity, and WIFI I have to be more responsible with the budgeting of my money. I think I can directly transfer these skills into my academic career so I can be more responsible with doing my homework on time
                        The second major event this year was my first co-op. I got an internship at London Computer Systems as a Software Quality Assurance Tester. This was my first ever internship in the tech field so understandably I was very nervous to start. I wasn't sure what I would be expected to know and how much they would be willing to teach me. After my first week my nerves were almost completely gone. Meeting the team I worked with and how receptive they were of me was amazing. They’ve had co-ops in the past so they knew I wouldn’t know much coming in. For the first few months of my co-op my main responsibility was to test bug fixes so no new bugs made it out to production. I accomplished this in many ways while learning many different techniques. Some of the software I learned to use was Katalon, Postman, and Jmeter. I think I’ll be able to use all of these programs in my future jobs and possibly even in my academic career. Then for about the last month of my co-op I got the opportunity to start software development training. Now this was a big step because usually co-ops don’t start this until their second rotation so I was very grateful to have the opportunity. I learned so many things and a lot of it was very challenging to understand. My co-workers and my manager were very helpful because whenever I had questions about anything they would always make time to help me when I needed it. I am definitely going to apply that in my classes even when it is hard to ask questions sometimes because I don’t want to look stupid or dumb.
                    Overall, I learned so much in this past year that will help me accomplish my future academic and professional goals.</p>

                    <p class="review">I think most people could say, but especially for me, my first year in college has been a series of ups and downs and unexpected turns. I have overcome many different obstacles that come with living on your own for the first time, taking college level courses, and the lasting impact that the COVID pandemic has had on campus. 
                        Firstly, the daunting experience of living on my own for the first time challenged me to become more responsible. Living in a dorm may not be completely on my own, but it is still drastically different than living with my parents at home. At home I always had my parents as my backbone for anything I needed. Here on campus my RA and most importantly my friends helped with problems that I ran into. Over my semesters in my dorm, it made me realize how important it is to stay organized with all of my schoolwork, chores, and anything else I needed to do. Staying organized helped me stay on top of my schoolwork which helped limit stress and helped me have time to make new friends and play intramural sports. 
                        Not only was moving into a dorm daunting but going to classes in big lecture halls with completely different structures than my high school classes scared me a little bit. At the beginning of my first semester, I learned about all the support organizations at UC to help students that either need help with the content of the classes or the stress of them. Going to study groups and office hours with my professors helped a lot when I was studying for exams because it was a lot easier to have someone else be able to explain what I was doing wrong than just reading a textbook. I learned that just because I got help for certain classes does not mean I am any less smart than my classmates. 
                        When I first got to campus, we had to constantly wear masks, take COVID checks, and provide a negative COVID test. Even for a bit during the second semester we had online school. The constant changing of protocol made everyone unsure of what came next and when it all would stop. I was always worried I would catch COVID then have to miss two weeks of classes which would significantly impact my mental health and my grades. Being in person with direct teaching is much more effective for me so COVID had a substantial impact on that. During the two weeks where we had distance learning my professors were extremely helpful as they knew this was mostly new to everyone and they were extremely helpful when it came to the course material. 
                        All the obstacles I faced throughout my freshman year were challenging but I was also able to overcome them because of all the support I had from my new family here at UC.</p>
